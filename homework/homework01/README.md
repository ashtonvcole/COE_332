# Homework 01

This first homework demonstrates basic understanding of Python and git functionality.

## `script01.py`

This script finds 5 of the longest words in a given file, assuming that each word is given its own line. Here's how it works.

1. It reads in a word from the file.
2. If the list of longest words is shorter than 5, the word is automatically added.
3. Otherwise, the length of the word is compared to the ones in the list. If it's longer than a given word, then that word is replaced.

### Sample Output

```
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch's
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconioses
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
methylenedioxymethamphetamine's
```

## `script02.py`

This script prints out 5 names that are exactly 8 letters long, excluding spaces. It uses the 'names' module to generate random names until 5 such names are found.

### Sample Output

```
Lacy Gray
Tony West
Tom Smith
Troy Sims
Jean Tobe
```

## `script03.py`

This script uses the sane module to generate 5 random full names. It displays the number of letters in each, excluding spaces.

### Sample Output

```
Troy White - 9 letters
Richard Stockton - 15 letters
Carol Saling - 11 letters
Dorothy Nieves - 13 letters
Mark Ballenger - 13 letters
```
