# Turbididty REST API

A Mars rover needs to sift through turbidity data to determine if and when the water is safe to use for experiments. It accesses hourly samples from a REST API on ![GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjallen/turbidity/main/turbidity_data.json) and averages the calculated turbidities of 5 most recent data points to estimate the turbidity of the water. It then uses an exponential decay model to determine when the turbidity will reach a safe level. This assignment demonstrates leveraging Python to access and manipulate data from a REST API.
